# HTML Text
## HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

# theres two types of markup:

1- Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs.

2- Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation.

# HEADINGS
- HTML has <b>six "levels"</b> of headings from ``<h1>``to ``<h6>``,Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes.
- The contents of an ``<h1>`` element is the largest, and the contents of 
an ``<h6>`` element is the smallest.

# PARAGRAPHS
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening ``<p>`` tag and closing ``</p>`` tag.

# Bold & Italic
- By enclosing words in the tags ``<b>``and ``</b>`` we can make characters appear bold.
- By enclosing words in the tags ``<i>`` and ``</i>`` we can make characters appear italic.
  
# Superscript & Subscrip
- The ``<sup>`` element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts.
- The ``<sub>`` element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas .
  
# Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag ``<br />``.

# Strong & Emphasis
- The use of the ``<strong>`` element indicates that its content has strong importance.
- The ``<em>`` element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.

# Abbreviations & Acronyms
If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the ``<abbr>`` element can be used.

# introduction csss :
## <b>CSS</b> stands to Cascding Style Sheet.

## CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.

## CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box .

## CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements.

<b>CSS rule</b> contains two parts: a <em>selector</em> and a declaration.
<sup>Selectors</sup> indicate which element the rule applies to.

#### The ``<link>`` element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page, it lives inside the ``<head>`` element.

- # Using External CSS
- # Using Internal CSS
- # using inline Css 
  
### Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

### CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Basic Java :
## <b>A script</b> is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.

##  Each individual instruction or step is known as a <b>statement<b/>.
## <i>Statements<i/> should end with a semicolon. 
### JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE.

# To write a comment in java script:
- you use a multi-line comment, starting with the /* characters and ending with the */ characters.
- In a single-line comment, anything that follows the <b>//</b>two forward slash characters .
  
  # A <em>variable<em/> is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change each time a script runs. 

  # How To Declare Variable:
1- use word ``(var)`` its a reserved word.

2- determinr variable name has a meaning. 

3- end the sentence withsemicolon <em>;<em/>.

4- if you want to assign a value to variable use assign operator <b>(=)</b>

# DATA TYPES :
- NUMERIC DATA TYPE 
- STRING DATA TYPE 
- BOOLEAN DATA TYPE

## An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
## An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value.
### there are two types of expressions:
1- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE.

2- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE.

<b>Expressions</b> rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.

# decision and loops:
## <sup>Conditional statements<sup/> allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

## Comparison operators ``(===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)`` are used to compare two operands.

## <sup>Logical operators<sup/> allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

### if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
