## You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. 

### You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS.

# Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.

# Where the <img> elements appear in the HTML, rather than using width and height attributes you can use these names as values for the class attribute. 

# In the CSS, you add selectors for each of the class names, then use the CSS width and height properties to control the image dimensions.

# There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:

1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.
2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.
   
### These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.
   
# there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:

1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.
   

# The background-repeat property can have four values:

1. repeat:
The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically.
2. repeat-x:
The image is repeated horizontally only .
3. repeat-y:
The image is repeated vertically only.
4. no-repeat:
The image is only shown once.   

## To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.
